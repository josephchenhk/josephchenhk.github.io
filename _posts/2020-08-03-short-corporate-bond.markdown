# Sell short/borrow cash bonds
This way is similar to shorting a stock. 

* At t=0, 

Lender --(bond)--> seller --(bond)--> market counterparty [seller receives proceeds of the bond]

* At t=1,

Lender <--(bond)-- seller <--(bond)-- market counterparty [seller buys back the bond (hopefully at a lower price) and returns it to the lender]

# Credit Default Swaps (CDS)

# Total Return Swaps (TRS)
